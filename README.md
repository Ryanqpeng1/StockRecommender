# Stock Recommender
Personal project, a stock recommendation system that uses machine learning to predict whether to buy or hold stocks. The goal is to help investors make informed decisions based on historical stock data and technical indicators like moving averages, RSI, and MACD. The program first collects historical stock data using the yfinance library, then calculates various technical indicators for each stock. The model is trained using a Random Forest classifier, which takes the stock data and technical indicators as features to predict the stock's movement. To evaluate the model, I calculated its accuracy by comparing the predicted outcomes with actual stock price movements on a test set. The model is currently achieving an accuracy of 0.48.
